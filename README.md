# Why ? 
I wanted a tool to quickly put sounds on a soundboard and play them by pressing arbitrary keys. 
Also I wanted to do it using React + Redux to train myself for a future opportunity

# See demo 
[rdm.hosh.it/soundboard](https://rdm.hosh.it/soundboard/)

# How to run 
The boilerplate has been generated by [Create React App](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started), so simply :

- Clone the code
- `npm run build`
- Serve the build/ through a server of your choice.
